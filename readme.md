This package let's you use [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) for building the renderer of your [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) apps! ðŸ¤ 

## Usage

Firstly, install the package using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
npm install --save electron-next
```

Then load it:

```js
const prepareRenderer = require('electron-next')
```

As the final step, call the package:

- `<path>`: The path to the directory containing the renderer (relative to the app's root directory). If the paths for development and production aren't the same, this can be an object holding a `development` and a `production` key with their respective paths (string|array).
- `<port>`: Used for running [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) in development (number, **optional**, defaults to `8000`).

```js
await prepareRenderer(<path>, <port>)
```

## Caught a Bug?

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Link the package to the global module directory: `npm link`
3. Within the module you want to test your local development instance of the package, just link it to the dependencies: `npm link electron-next`. Instead of the default one from npm, node will now use your clone of the package!
